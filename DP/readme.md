2. write a memo solution - express indexes, express possiblity and write max/min, define base cases
3. write a tabulation method

DP on subsequences : subsequence
Dp on LongestIncreasing subsequence : Imp problem there is a difference between the (recursive,dp,tab) and the main solution please do

Tablulation : 
  wrtie the base cases
  express every state in for loops
copy recursion
